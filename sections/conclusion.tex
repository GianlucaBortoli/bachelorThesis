\chapter{Conclusion and future work}\label{chp:conclusion}

% + enhencments on web gui: 
%   [+] user authentication so that every user has its own space and computation power on 
%       the server
% + implement solving algorithms described in "Stochastic Analysis of Periodic Real-Time Systems"
% + try to introduce multithreading in some parts, if possible, for performance boost
% + talk about the possible future of this tool (to be published and available to everyone)

The tool presented in this thesis shows how it is possible to improve the design and the analisys phase of soft real-time systems. As a result PROSIT can be employed especially in academic research, but a use in other fields is not excluded.\\
Possible future enhancements can include some improvements in the web GUI, such as user authentication, and the implementation of complex but efficient algorithms to solve Quasi-Birth-Death processes described in \cite{futurework}. This would make the tool more complete and usable for further research applications.\\
Another possibility is to try introducing multithreading where it is feasible in order to enhence the overall performance of the tool.\\
It is possible to affirm that this is certainly a solid starting point for those who will work and contribute to the PROSIT project in the future.
