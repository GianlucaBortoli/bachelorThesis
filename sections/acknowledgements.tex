I take this opportunity to express gratitude to my supervisor, professor Luigi Palopoli, for sharing his expertise and for guiding me throughtout the draft of this thesis, and to his PhD student Bernardo Villalba Fr√≠as, who helped and supported me during the last part of PROSIT's development.\\
Most importantly, none of this would have been possible without the patience and the encouragements of my family.\\
Last but not the least, I would like to thank my girlfriend Valentina and all my friends for helping me to believe in myself and for their essential contribute.
